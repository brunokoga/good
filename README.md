# The Good List 

Everyone has a list of good companies and people they believe to be ethical, smart, and hard-working—doing it the right way, for the right reasons. Mine just happens to be on GitHub.

### Disclaimer

This list should not be considered complete, nor does non-inclusion imply anything. For more information, and before complaining about it, read the [WAT](https://github.com/ElDragonRojo/good/blob/master/WAT.md).

Please [file issues](../../issues?state=open) to suggest changes, and fork this list to create your own, because I certainly don't know who all the good people are.

### How to think of this list

If you needed a job, and I could afford it, I would hire you if:

1. Your name is on this list.
2. You worked for a company on this list.
3. You were introduced to me by someone whose name is in __bold__.

### Legend

Names in __bold__ are people of exceptional quality—typically people I have worked with or know well enough to go so far as to risk my personal reputation to vouch for them. Names in *italics* are intensely strong-willed people with me on the A* list.

Industry Legends are people who have been around for a very long time, are very well known, have been involved in so many things that there's no easy way to describe them, or are generally considered to have made such tremendous contributions to the industry in the past that nothing further is expected from them.
